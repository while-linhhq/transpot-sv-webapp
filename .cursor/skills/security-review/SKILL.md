  Perform a thorough security audit of the codebase and produce a prioritized report
  (Critical/High/Medium/Low) with file/line pointers. Focus on secrets exposure, authn/authz
  gaps, injection risks (SQL/command/code), unsafe eval/dynamic execution, insecure cookies and
  headers, overly broad CORS, dependency vulnerabilities, and sensitive data leakage in logs.

# Security Review Skill

## Purpose
Systematically scan the codebase for security vulnerabilities and produce a prioritized report.

## Checklist

### 🔴 Critical (Check First)
- [ ] Hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords in source files
  ```bash
  grep -r "password\s*=\s*['\"]" src/
  grep -r "api_key\s*=\s*['\"]" src/
  ```
- [ ] `.env` files accidentally committed
  ```bash
  git log --all --full-history -- .env
  ```
- [ ] SQL injection via string concatenation
- [ ] `eval()` or `new Function()` with user input

### 🟡 High Priority
- [ ] Missing authentication on protected routes
- [ ] Missing authorization (privilege escalation)
- [ ] Passwords stored in plain text
- [ ] JWT secrets too short or exposed
- [ ] No rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Missing input validation

### 🟢 Medium Priority
- [ ] Missing security headers (run Helmet scan)
- [ ] CORS configured too broadly (`origin: *`)
- [ ] Dependencies with known vulnerabilities
  ```bash
  npm audit
  ```
- [ ] Sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Missing HTTPS enforcement

### ℹ️ Low / Informational
- [ ] Error messages revealing stack traces to client
- [ ] Missing CSP headers
- [ ] Cookie security flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

## Output Format
```markdown
# Security Review Report — [Date]

## Critical Issues
[List with file:line references]

## High Priority Issues
[List with file:line references]

## Recommendations
[Prioritized action items]
```

## Commands
```bash
# Dependency audit
npm audit --audit-level=moderate

# Check for secret patterns
grep -rn --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" \
  -E "(password|secret|api_key|token)\s*=\s*['\"][^'\"]{8,}" src/
```
